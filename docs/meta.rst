How This Site is Built
======================

{% from 'dexy.jinja' import code, codes with context -%}

Content
-------

Site content is written in reStructuredText format.

http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html

This is a highly structured markup format which can be rendered into HTML,
LaTeX (for PDF) and several other formats.

{{ codes('dexy.yaml|idio', 'rst-content') }}

Inputs
------

All .rst files found are run through the `jinja` filter with various inputs
made available to them.

{{ codes('dexy.yaml|idio', 'rst-inputs') }}

The `code` bundle is:

{{ codes('dexy.yaml|idio', 'code') }}

The `docs.sqlite3` file contains metadata from the javadocs for the OpenGamma project.


HTML Pages
..........

HTML pages are generated by running .rst pages through the `jinja` filter, then
the `rstbody` filter which converts the rst into HTML. Dexy's website reporter
then applies a website template to arrive at the final output.

The main template is:

{{ code('shared/_template.html|pyg') }}

The template is split up into several sub-templates which are included in the
main template.

The header is:

{{ code('shared/_head.html|pyg') }}

The assets being referenced are copied by dexy, they are specified in the
`dexy.yaml` config as follows:

{{ codes('dexy.yaml|idio', 'assets') }}

Any other file extensions that should be copied unchanged to the output should
be added to that list. The `res/` directory is a copy of the main OpenGamma
static site's assets, the `shared/` directory contains content specific to the
dexy-generated html and pdf content.
