Jython examples

A number of `Jython <http://www.jython.org/>`_ \-based examples are available which show how to make use of and interact with various classes in the OG-Analytics package. These can be run using Jython, or used as a guide for interacting with the classes via Java. A list of currently available examples is `here <http://docs-static.opengamma.com/dev/analytics/examples/>`_ , with many more examples in development. The source code underlying these examples is `available from the Github repo <https://github.com/OpenGamma/OG-Platform/tree/master/projects/OG-Analytics/docs/examples>`_ .
