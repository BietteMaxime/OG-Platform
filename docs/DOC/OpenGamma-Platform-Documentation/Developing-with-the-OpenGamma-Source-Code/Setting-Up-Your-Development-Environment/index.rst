You can download the pre-built binary and source Jar files of the OpenGamma Platform from the `OpenGamma Developer Site <http://developer.opengamma.com>`_  both with and without dependencies.  All you need then is to add them to your classpath; look at the documentation here and in the `Javadocs <http://docs-static.opengamma.com/0.7.0/java/javadocs>`_ .

There is also a source tarball that contains all the dependent libraries decoupled from Ivy, so you can just fire up your favorite IDE with no setup at all.

For serious work on the Platform, we'd recommend cloning `our repository on GitHub <http://github.com/OpenGamma/OG-Platform>`_  and using Ivy to manage dependencies.
