title: Developing with the OpenGamma Source Code
shortcut: DOC:Developing with the OpenGamma Source Code
---
This guide is for people who want to **build, explore and modify the code in the OpenGamma Platform itself**.  

It is not really necessary for those who simply wish to make plugins or applications integrating with the OpenGamma Platform. Those instructions are in `Developing Applications to Integrate with the OpenGamma Platform </confluence/DOC/OpenGamma-Platform-Documentation/Developing-Applications-to-Integrate-with-the-OpenGamma-Platform/index.rst>`_ .
