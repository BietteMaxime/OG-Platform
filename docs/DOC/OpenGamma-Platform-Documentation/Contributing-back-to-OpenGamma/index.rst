title: Contributing back to OpenGamma
shortcut: DOC:Contributing back to OpenGamma

OpenGamma welcomes contributions from other developers and  users of the system.

The bug tracking and feature request system (`Jira <http://jira.opengamma.com>`_ ) is publicly available. We also welcome input on documentation, new components and code changes. Frequently, an issue will be discussed first on the `forums <http://forums.opengamma.com/forum/>`_  and then be raised as a bug or feature request.

Contributing code

First, you need to fork the main `OpenGamma Platform repository on GitHub <https://github.com/OpenGamma/OG-Platform>`_  and learn how to `Using Ant from the Command Line </confluence/DOC/OpenGamma-Platform-Documentation/Developing-with-the-OpenGamma-Source-Code/Working-with-Ant/Using-Ant-from-the-Command-Line/index.rst>`_  and `Running Tests with Ant </confluence/DOC/OpenGamma-Platform-Documentation/Developing-with-the-OpenGamma-Source-Code/Working-with-Ant/Running-Tests-with-Ant/index.rst>`_  the system. We require this so that we can track why particular code  went into the system, and what code went into resolving Jira issues.

There are, however, certain standards that we require before accepting code:


*  Your code must have appropriate documentation. While our code  style doesn't rely on extensive and unnecessary documentation, we **do** insist that things like interfaces have documentation.


*  Your code must meet the OpenGamma formatting standards. All of  our code has one formatting standard for readability, and we insist that  all contributions match that standard.


*  Your code must match our testing standards. We insist that:


   *  All code has appropriate, automated testing to ensure that the code works appropriately; and


   *  All tests are clean.

IP assignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


All major contributions require an IP assignment agreement to OpenGamma. This ensures that commercial customers receive a commercial license to the OpenGamma  Platform, and that we have the legal authority to release the code under such a license. However, our IP assignment agreement has an embedded  license back to you to allow you to do whatever you like with your  contribution. Combined with the Apache v2 license, this means contributing is positive to both parties.
