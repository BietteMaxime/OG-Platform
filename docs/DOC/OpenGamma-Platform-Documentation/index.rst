{section}The OpenGamma Platform&nbsp;is a comprehensive solution for financial analytics capable of satisfying the full range of front-office and risk requirements. It supports pre-trade ad-hoc calculations, near-real-time streaming analytics, batch/overnight risk calculations, and complex historical scenarios and stress tests in the same system.

Built as a completely open architecture, the OpenGamma Platform is designed so that every component can be individually used, or individually replaced, based on customer requirements. We don't believe in forklift upgrades, and we built the OpenGamma Platform so that they're never necessary: individual projects can use OpenGamma components when they provide a clear advantage, and later migrate additional portions of their infrastructure if and when time and resources permit.

If you are a new user, we recommend reading the [Platform Overview]&nbsp;section first before moving on to [Getting Started].
