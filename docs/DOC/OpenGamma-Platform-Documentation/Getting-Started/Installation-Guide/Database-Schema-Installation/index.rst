title: Database Schema Installation
shortcut: DOC:Database Schema Installation

If you've downloaded the binary release, then there is no need to do a separate schema installation.  The examples run using an embedded HyperSQL database and all that is required to set it up is to run the `./scripts/init-example-db.sh` script to populate it with example data.  If you wish to run the examples against a Postgres installation, follow the instructions below to create databases with the appropriate schemas.
