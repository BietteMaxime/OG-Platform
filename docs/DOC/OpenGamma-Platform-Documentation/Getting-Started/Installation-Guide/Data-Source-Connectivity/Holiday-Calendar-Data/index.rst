title: Holiday Calendar Data
shortcut: DOC:Holiday Calendar Data
---
Holiday data is a key requirement of any trading, risk and analytics system.  Without accurate holiday calendars, it is impossible to accurately price securities.  Because of the effort required to maintain an accurate calendar database, there are many commercial holiday data providers.  Out-of-the-box, our open source release simply assumes that weekends are the only holidays.  To run a proper production system, you'll need to source holiday data from one of these providers, or maintain your own holiday database using our management interface.  We do however have available integration with one of the world's leading commercial holiday data providers, `Copp Clark <http://www.coppclark.com/>`_ .  These tools are currently not part of the open source release, but we will be shortly moving them into the main Open Source OpenGamma Platform git repository.  Please contact us for further information if you require them.
