title: Enabling GICS Code mapping
shortcut: DOC:Enabling GICS Code mapping
---
OpenGamma is able to resolve Global Industry Classification Standard (GICSÂ®) codes into the appropriate descriptions using an Excel sheet of GICS code mappings. While no such GICS map is included with the OpenGamma release, it is possible to enable this feature by simply dropping in one of the GICS map Excel sheets that are available for a number of languages from `Standard & Poor's website <http://www.standardandpoors.com/indices/gics/en/us>`_ . The file must be renamed to '`gics_map.xls`' and can be located anywhere on the classpath.

Please note that it is the user's responsibility to maintain compliance with the relevant Standard & Poor licensing conditions.
