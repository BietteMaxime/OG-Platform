Overview
........

The main purpose of this maintenance release is to incorporate some feedback from early downloaders.  Some of the highlights include:

*  A new package containing all the dependencies, meaning your first build happens a lot faster


*  Some fixes for the Eclipse project imports


*  `git pull` from within our Ant tasks now use https instead of ssh, allowing it to operate through firewalls more easily


*  User interface improvements to show currencies, constraints on columns and more appropriately format output values in general (you need a data source to see this!)
