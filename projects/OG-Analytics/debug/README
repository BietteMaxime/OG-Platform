A utility for testing/debugging Java classpaths with Dexy.

When run using Dexy, this utility will report on which JAR files are providing class definitions.

You can edit the .java file to include other classes for reporting.

To run this do:

dexy setup
dexy

from within this directory.

Report will be in output/DebugClasses.txt

Entries will look something like this:

> class com.opengamma.financial.model.volatility.smile.function.SABRHaganVolatilityFunction
>   jar:file:/mnt/OG-Platform/lib/jar/com.opengamma/og-analytics/og-analytics-0.9.0-local-20111116215934.jar!
