/**
 * Interface to the IZY library.
 * The IZY library provides a vectorised interface to many common mathematical functions.
 * 
 * Note on complex number representation:
 * 
 * 
 * Methods declared to take Double Precision Complex have their double precision complex valued arrays passed as double[] due to the lack
 * of a native complex number representation in java. Classes implementing from this interface expect double precision complex values
 * to be packed into a double[] as alternating double precision real values and double precision complex values.
 * 
 *  
 * For example take complex numbers X and Y, and let the notation rX indicate the real part of X and iX the imaginary part, the valid packing 
 * would then take the form: 
 * double[] foo = {rX, iX, rY, iY}
 * The reason for this packing is down to internal representation of complex data structures in native libraries.
